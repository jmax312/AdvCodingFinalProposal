##Project Proposal: "Focus"

Many children, especially those with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) struggle with staying focused on tasks, as well as with memorization ([source](http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/autism_spectrum_disorder_learning.html/context/1037)). The idea behind "Focus" would be to help build these skills through an iPad game. 

For this project in particular, I would only be making a single, short, basic level, to demonstrate what it could be and give a base that could be expanded upon. In this case, the play would last 2 minutes. During that time, the player must keep looking at the screen. A face tracker via CV would keep track of how long they stay looking at the screen. An on-screen timer would show how long they've kept looking. If they look away, it will reset (but the game play timer continues). A shape will appear for a few seconds and then disappear, replaced by 3 other shapes, one of which matches what was shown. The player has to choose which one matches. They receive one point for each right answer. They can also get a bonus of 2 points per second on the focus timer at the end.

Addons that I am considering using:
ofxCV and openCV for the face detection

There may be others that I find I need later on as well, especially for iOS.
